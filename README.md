## The repository contains samples of parametrized tests of Android mobile apps.

- **_cucumber_calculator_** - testing Google Translator by Appium + Cucumber (Cucumber is a very interesting framework that allows us to transfer the business language to the programming one. Importantly, the scenarios can be written not only by IT professionals but also by people from the business.)

- **_cucumber_translator_** - testing Calculator by Appium + Cucumber


- **_parametrized_** - testing Google Translator by Appium (_translationData.csv_ contains a list of languages, phrases and their translations that we want to do. It is a very simple solution that allows us to add additional arguments at any time without changing the test.)


A physical Android device (Samsung Galaxy M21) was used (see _variables.properties_ file).
